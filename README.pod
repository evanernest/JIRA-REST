JIRA::REST - Thin wrapper around JIRA's REST APIs

L<JIRA|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira> is a proprietary bug
tracking system from
L<Atlassian|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/>.

This module implements a thin wrapper around JIRA's REST APIs:

=over

=item * L<JIRA Core REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/server/>

This rich API superseded the old L<JIRA SOAP
API|http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html>
which isn't supported anymore as of JIRA version 7.

=item * L<JIRA Service Desk REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the JIRA Service Desk application.

=item * L<JIRA Software REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the JIRA Software application.
